It is time for me to rotate my very old key out of use, and replace it
with one that has a better cipher and longer key-length.

The old key will continue to be valid until 01 August 2015 at 00:01Z,
but I prefer all future correspondence to come to the new one.  I
would also like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of
trust.  This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition.

the old key was:

pub   1024D/CB67593B (4EA9946ACB67593B) 2004-10-27
      Key fingerprint = 343A CD9A 5AD7 D62A F75F  4CA3 4EA9 946A CB67 593B
      

And the new key is:

pub   4096R/67530EB5 (30BB046567530EB5) 2015-06-11 [expires: 2016-06-10]
      Key fingerprint = 740A B190 A549 3F70 0FF5  CB48 30BB 0465 6753 0EB5
      

To fetch the full key (including a photo uid, which is commonly
stripped by public keyservers), you can get it with:

  wget -q -O- http://www.asgaard.org/cdl/cdl.asc | gpg --import -

The old key can similarly be fetched by:

  wget -q -O- http://www.asgaard.org/cdl/cdl-old.asc | gpg --import -
  
Or, to fetch my new key from a public key server, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 67530EB5

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 67530EB5

If you don't already know my old key, or you just want to be double
extra paranoid, you can check the fingerprint against the one above:

  gpg --fingerprint 67530EB5

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the UIDs match
what you expect, I'd appreciate it if you would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 67530EB5

Lastly, if you could upload these signatures, i would appreciate it.
You can either send me an e-mail with the new signatures (if you have
a functional MTA on your system):

  gpg --armor --export 67530EB5 | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' cdl@asgaard.org

Or you can just upload the signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 67530EB5

If you do the later, please let me know you have done so.

Please let me know if you have questions, and sorry in advance for the bother.

Cordially,

Christopher
