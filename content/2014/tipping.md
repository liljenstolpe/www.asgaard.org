I was struck by commentary around the discussion about a potential increase in
the minimum wage for
[San Francisco](http://sfist.com/2014/06/16/san_franciscos_proposed_15_minimum.php)
to $15 USD per hour, which is very similar to what
[Seattle](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nick-hanauer-seattle-minimum-wage-20140530-story.html#page=1)
has already
[done](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023753163_wagevotexml.html).
It seems as if the restaurant owners' associations in each city are
looking for a carve-out for _tipped_ workers in both the 
[Seattle](http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2023423265_minimumwagerestaurantsxml.html)
and 
[San Francisco](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/15-wage-too-much-to-swallow-restaurant-group-5554554.php)
cases, and threaten **very** expensive meals if they don't get
it. If you look at this argument rationally, those restaurant owners
are basically saying that the only way they can provide an affordable
service is for their customers to directly subsidize the salary of
their work force.  In the United States, we call that subsidy a _tip_.

Let's look at this argument.  Normally, when I engage a vendor to
provide a service, such as repair my car, fix a chipped tooth,
_etc_. I don't expect to be told that the service was _X_ dollars, but
I need to pay the actual employee who performed the service their
wage on top of the bill I received for the service. I expect that the
total cost of providing that service is built into price I paid,
_including_ the cost of labor. Why is this different in the restaurant
business?

If I didn't know better, I would think that the restaurant business is
using this technique to obscure the actual cost of the product they
are trying to sell, but no industry would ever

[this](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/12/closing-fees-fair-and-foul/index.htm)
to their _valued_ customers.  I believe there is even a government
[agency](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/12/closing-fees-fair-and-foul/index.htm)
in the US that will step in if an industry actually were to attempt
such a nefarious practice.

Now, the US is fairly unique in the world in that tipping is
expected, and the reason given is that the person who receives the tip
is not fairly compensated for their work without the tip.  Most of the
rest of the world views a tip as it was originally intended, a
_gratuity_ that rewards exemplary service.  I travel all over the
world, and only in the US do I feel obliged to tip.  That removes the
reward component, and makes it a service fee or tax.  It no longer
represents the _thank you_ that it was originally intended to provide.

The rest of the world pays it's service workforce a living wage, or at
least one that isn't predicated on tip income.  I don't see the cost
of services in those other parts of the world out-of-line with what I
pay in the US.  Are we saying that the rest of the world is just
better, smarter, or more efficient in delivering those same services,
such that they can pay better wages and still hit the same price
points without relying on the customer to pay a hidden additional
salary subsidy to the employee?  Say it isn't so...
