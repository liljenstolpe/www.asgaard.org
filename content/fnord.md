## What Are You Looking For? ##
I'm sure it doesn't exist.  Why don't you just move [along](http://www.asgaard.org).

## Fnords Don't Exist ##
So why are you looking for them?  Trust us, there are no Fnords.  Let me show you 
[something](http://www.asgaard.org) much more to your liking.

## Why Do You Persist ##
Even if Fnords theoretically existed (trust us, they don't) it probably wouldn't be productive
to look for them.  In fact, it may even be contrary to your best interests.  It's well past the time
that you should be [moving along](http://www.asgaard.org).

## Now You've Done It ##
We've had to notify ![the Men In Black](/img/mib-small.png "The Authorities").  It's best if you just stay put now.
Trying to [run](http://www.asgaard.org/) will just make you tired.  It's best to just sit down and relax, 
it will all be over soon, we promise.
