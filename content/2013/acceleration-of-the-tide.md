Over the last few weeks, I've been reflecting on the latest round of
scandals emanating from Washington D.C.  For those of you who have
been living under a rock on the dark side of the moon, here's a
synopsis:

* The IRS has been
  [targeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_IRS_scandal)
  organizations that have specific political orientations.
* The NSA was caught with it's hands in multiple cookie jars, multiple
  times
  
	  -[Intercepting](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order)
  _metadata_ on communications in the United States _without_ legal
  oversight.
	  - [Collecting](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order)
  data from individuals Internet activities with the assistance of
  major Internet infrastructure and content providers.
	  - Potentially
        [Listening](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589495-38/nsa-spying-flap-extends-to-contents-of-u.s-phone-calls/)
        in to domestic phone calls without warrants (although the
        congress-critter who leaked that little gem is now
        [back-peddling](http://www.zdnet.com/nsa-can-allegedly-listen-to-phone-calls-without-warrants-report-7000016864/)
        on the allegation.  However, the NUCLEON project that is
        mentioned in the
        [CNet](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589495-38/nsa-spying-flap-extends-to-contents-of-u.s-phone-calls/)
        link is almost as _interesting_.

However, when we look further back, we have lots of things that were
meant to be buried and never noticed:

* A certain big agriculture [company](http://www.monsanto.com/)
  received a bit of a
  [gift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer_Assurance_Provision) from
  friendly senators and congress-critters.
* We surrendered (or had surrendered on our behalf) a
  [few](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2011/12/05/the-national-defense-authorization-act-is-the-greatest-threat-to-civil-liberties-americans-face/)
  of our Constitutional guarantees in the name of _security_.
* The movie industry has
  [tried](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act),
  [again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act), and
  [again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combating_Online_Infringement_and_Counterfeits_Act)
  to try and put the _Internet_ djinn back in the bottle rather than
  actually adapt to it and move on (maybe they should read
  [this](http://www.amazon.com/Evolve-Die-Seven-Rethink-Business/dp/0470593458)).
* A US soldier
  [leaked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak)
  a _few_ cables to [Wikileaks](http://wikileaks.org).

The list is actually quite long and getting longer.  And, obviously,
it is not just a US phenomena.  As many have said, it is becoming
harder to keep secrets.  On balance, this **may** be a good
thing. Large projects (either corporate or public sector) involve lots
of people.  And today, more so than in the past, many of those
individuals are not directly employed by the entities trying to keep a
lid on things.  The NSA leaks of last week were exposed by civilian
contractor with a beltway [bandit](http://www.boozallen.com).  His
personal beliefs (we still allow those, by the way, at least for now,
we do) were of the libertarian bent.  The various bills noted above
(some passed, unfortunately, others were stopped) were noticed by an
activist and interested community, that is enabled by rapid
dissemination of information, targeted at those who may find it
interesting.

Unlike past times, an _interesting_ nugget of data doesn't need to
pass a high _interest threshold_ (news editor, _etc._) to become
public knowledge.  Anyone can make information public to interested
groups. Once it's out there, a much larger community can easily look
at it, evaluate it, and discuss it.  Furthermore, it can act on that
information (swamp the switchboard and e-mail servers of the US
Congress, for example).

No longer is there an easy choke point for the government, or
corporations to choke the flow of embarrassing information.  This is a
good thing.  There is no way, yet, to sue (or arrest) [__The
Internet__](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png).
Individuals who expose the information may face
repercussions, but if they are motivated by their ideology (which has
always been a driver for secrecy violations, by the way), they may be
willing to take the personal _hit_ for the _greater good_.

The flip side of this is that there is no way to stop information that
is actually harmful (_e.g._ some of the information in the diplomatic
cables leaks noted above _may_ have been hazardous to some of the
sources mentioned).  This is certainly a concern, and something that
needs to be addressed.  However, existing tools to control and limit
this kind of risk are __very__ open to abuse by those who would be
_embarrassed_ by a disclosure that actually carries no substantial
risk of injury or damage.

We, globally, and certainly in the US, have become too comfortable
with secrecy, decisions that are made on our behalf in the name of
security that, in fact, reduce our real security as human beings
(natural rights).  What's more, in the name of secrecy, we haven't
even been involved in the debate leading to these decisions.  They are
made _in our best interests_, without consultation.

The events of this last week, and more broadly, over the last number
of years should put the keepers of the secrets on notice that their
job will be __much__ harder than before.  All it takes is one person
to crack the door, and it's gone.

Maybe this realization will force a re-think about how we deal with
these issues.  What _must_ be considered secret?  Why _must_ it be
considered secret?  If it is really for the common good, then there
won't be much motivation to disclose.  However, if you would be
embarrassed, castigated, or indicted, to be associated with a secret,
maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place?  If you are going
to restrict people's liberties, maybe you need to consult with them
first, informed consent is a wonderful thing.

What am I saying, that is too radical a thought, no one would ever
actually make that determination on their own.

Two parting thoughts, both from some men I respect (emphasis is mine):

> let us save what remains: not by vaults and locks  which fence them
        from the public eye and use in consigning them to the waste of
        time, but by such a multiplication of copies, as shall place
        them beyond the reach of _accident_. 
		Thomas Jefferson

> The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by
	men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.
	Louis D. Brandeis
